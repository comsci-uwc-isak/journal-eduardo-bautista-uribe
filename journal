Today we went on how to set up a VPN server with a raspberry pi.

I learned the basics of VPN, their purpose, and their inner workings. I also practiced my skills with the terminal and its
comands

I experienced some challenges when I had to connect my mac and android devices to the vpn, so I quickly looked for resources
online to be able to do so. 

I still have some questions on terms of the boundaries of this kind of server due to space constraints. How many users can 
connect to a single raspberry pi and what tasks they can perform without crowding the network.
