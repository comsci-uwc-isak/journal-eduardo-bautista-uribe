This experience was a great reminder of how fun Computer Science is. Also, it was a great review of what we learned last year.
I am very happy with the fact that we are using Github to reord our experiences since it is such an essential tool for coders. 
It is very encouraging to see this level of creativity put into the class format. I am personally very excited to study this
year's case study since I am big fan of block chain.
