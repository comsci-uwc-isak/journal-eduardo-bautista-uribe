Today we went over topic 3.13, pi, and html.
Learning over different networks and classifying them together as a class was very interactive.
Using the RÃ¥spberry Pi as a server to host our websties was one of the most valuable experiences so far. Hosting has 
always been one of the concepts in CS that has been difficult to grasp or visualize. That activty was both interactive,
educational and practical. Even though this was only an introduction, I feel more confident in these sort of topics.
I would need to study how these concepts are applied in bigger projects in case we want to deploy our website to the web.
Also, what services are the most popular to host a website and understand how they work.
