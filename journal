Today's class taught me essential concepts on networking. I did not know anything about how to classify networks based on
their size or topology. 

I found the raspberry pi practical really intersting. I love to play with hardware, so I grasped the concepts much faster 
than if I had gone through slides explaining those same conepts.

Also, going over the IP concepts and creating our own "ramen shop" was really fun.

I prefer this type of teaching compared to last year's.
